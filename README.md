DoD-Counterintelligence (CI) Certification Program Guide (Unclassified) 

This is a collection of Guides for the Training modules for Counterintelligence in the STEPP Program. 

CI022.16 CI Foreign Travel Briefing
This course assists Facility Security Officers (FSOs) working in cleared defense contract facilities in the development of their own tailored briefs. This course provides students with an outline of topics which are recommended for inclusion in a CI Foreign Travel Brief. A briefing template is included which FSOs may use, adding or subtracting information to fit their individual needs.

CI116.16 Counterintelligence Awareness and Reporting for DoD Employees
Department of Defense (DoD) Components are required by DoD Directive 5240.06 to provide Counterintelligence Awareness and Reporting training to all personnel within 30 days of initial assignment, or employment to the Component, and every 12 months thereafter. When an experienced Counterintelligence Agent is not available to provide such training in person, this web-based training may be used to meet the training requirement.

CI112.16 Counterintelligence Awareness and Security Brief
The "Counterintelligence Awareness and Security Brief" course was developed primarily for employees at cleared defense contractor facilities. This eLearning training enables these employees to complete the training at any time, to fulfill their initial or annual security, counterintelligence, and insider threat awareness training requirement. The emphasis of the training is on awareness of potential threats directed against U.S. technology; it also explains common suspicious activities, including insider threats that should be reported to the Facility Security Officer (FSO) in compliance with NISPOM 1-302. FSOs may use this training in conjunction with their company specific security protocols for duties applicable to the employee's job, to meet the Security Training and Briefings requirement outlined in NISPOM Chapter 3. The Industrial Security Letter 2016-02, specifically designates this course as an option for meeting the annual Insider Threat Awareness training for cleared industry employees.

CI020.16 Counterintelligence Concerns for National Security Adjudicators
This course provides students with an opportunity to practice identifying what constitutes a suspicious email while increasing awareness about the importance of reporting suspicious contacts.

CI010.16 Integrating Counterintelligence And Threat Awareness into Your Security Program
This course provides a thorough understanding of how counterintelligence (CI) and threat awareness are essential components of a comprehensive security program. The course provides an overview of the elements of a cleared facility, or unit security program. This overview includes identifying the purpose of a CI and threat awareness program, CI and threat awareness policy requirements for industry and Department of Defense (DoD) personnel, the role of the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) CI Directorate, the use of the analytical risk management process, key types of threats and common methods of collection operations, types of information most likely to be targeted by espionage, types of information that should be reported, and appropriate reporting requirements and procedures.

CI117.16 Protecting Assets in the NISP
The Protecting Assets in the NISP course provides a detailed explanation of the importance of CI awareness to effective industry security programs. Topics include the relationship between CI and security; CI and threat awareness policy for industry personnel; elements of an effective CI program; common types of threats and methods of operation; sources of threat information; threats related to U.S. Government-sensitive and -classified technologies; and CI and threat awareness reporting requirements and procedures.

CI141.16 Protecting Your Facility's Technology
Following courses (CI140.16) "The Relationship Between Counterintelligence and Security" and (CI142.16) "Sensitizing Facility Employees to Counterintelligence Concerns," the course will include a partially-offline independent activity where, in response to prompts, FSOs fill out a printable workbook with information specific to the technology at their facility. The course allows FSOs to stop the course at set intervals, make inquiries of people at their facility, and record information in their workbook. Once developed, the FSO can then use their workbook to perform counterintelligence-related functions. The course addresses several basic elements recommended for the FSO to have considered for protection of facility assets.

CI142.16 Sensitizing Facility Employees to Counterintelligence Concerns
This course provides Facility Security Officers (FSOs) with a fundamental understanding of the key communities or employees within a cleared defense contract facility that most frequently become targets of suspicious contacts. It will help the FSOs identify the potential vulnerabilities residing within each functional area so they can communicate with them and help prioritize needs for countermeasures. It provides the employees with an awareness of those collection methods used by foreign entities and the urgency for reporting those suspicious activities.

CI021.16 Suspicious Emails
This 15-minute eLearning course provides students with an opportunity to practice identifying what constitutes a suspicious email while increasing awareness about the importance of reporting suspicious contacts.

CI140.16 The Relationship Between Counterintelligence and Security
This course provides Facility Security Officers (FSOs) with an introduction to how counterintelligence (CI) is an essential component of a comprehensive security program. It focuses on shifting FSOs from a security only, defensive mindset, to a counterintelligence-type, proactive perspective. The course covers the relationship between CI and Security, the role of risk management in a security program, how to use threat information, and the essential elements of an effective CI program.

CI111.16 Thwarting The Enemy: Providing Counterintelligence & Threat Awareness to the Defense Industrial Base 
Thwarting the Enemy: Providing Counterintelligence and Threat Awareness to the Defense Industrial Base, was developed for employees working at cleared defense contractor facilities. This will allow employees to complete the training at any time to meet their annual Threat Awareness training requirement. The emphasis is to make employees aware of potential threats directed against U.S. technology. It also explains common suspicious activities which should be reported to the Facility Security Officer (FSO) in compliance with NISPOM 3-107 and 1-302. FSOs are encouraged to use this Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Counterintelligence Office-sponsored training to meet the Security Training and Briefings requirement outlined in NISPOM Chapter 3.
